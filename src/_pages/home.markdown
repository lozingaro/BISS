## What is the Bertinoro International Spring School?

The [Italian Computer Science PhD granting institutions](http://www.disi.unige.it/dottorato/coordinamento/) under the auspices of [GRIN](http://www.grin-informatica.it/), organizes an annual school offering graduate-level courses aimed at PhD students in Computer Science.
In addition to introducing students to timely research topics, the school is meant _to promote acquaintance and collaboration among young European researchers_.

The three [courses](courses) that will be offered this year are:

* [Hybrid Quantum Computing - A gentle introduction to Quantum Computing from a Software Engineering perspective](courses#hybrid-quantum-computing) by Juan Manuel Murillo
* [AI for health](courses#ai-for-health) by [Gianluigi Greco](https://www.mat.unical.it/~ggreco/), [Francesco Calimeri](https://www.mat.unical.it/calimeri/), and Pierangela Bruno
* [Shape your own programming language](courses#shape-your-own-programming-language) by [Walter Cazzola](https://cazzola.di.unimi.it/), and Luca Favalli

**Note!** The evaluation for each course is possible through a **final exam or project** as determined by the instructor.
