## Quantum Computing and Software Engineering

**Instructor**: Shaukat Ali (Simula Research Laboratory, Norway) is a Chief Research Scientist, Research Professor, and Head of the Department at Simula Research Laboratory in Oslo, Norway. He also holds an adjunct position at Oslo Metropolitan University. He focuses on devising novel methods for developing cyber-physical systems by applying various advanced techniques, such as artificial intelligence, digital twins, and quantum computing. He has led many national and European projects related to testing, search-based software engineering, model-based system engineering, and quantum software engineering. He regularly serves as a program committee member for software engineering conferences (e.g., ASE, FSE, ICSE, ICST) and organizing committees. Moreover, he serves as an associate editor for ACM TOSEM and Springer EMSE journals and is the steering committee chair for ICST and SSBSE. He is a co-founder of the international workshop on quantum software engineering and the international conference on quantum software. He also represents Simula in various quantum computing research and industrial networks nationally and internationally.

Quantum software will enable fascinating future applications. However, creating dependable quantum software that executes on quantum computers and delivers these applications requires new software engineering methods, tools, and best practices. To this end, a novel field of Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is emerging, covering areas like quantum software modeling, coding, testing, debugging, and repair, which will be a key focus of this course, presenting different methods across these areas. Moreover, this course will focus on engineering dependable quantum and classical software in combination with two groundbreaking technologies: quantum computing and AI. To this end, this course will cover techniques, including applying classical AI methods to solve QSE problems. Moreover, it will cover techniques on using quantum AI techniques (e.g. quantum extreme learning machines and quantum annealing) to solve classical software engineering problems (e.g. testing).

## Building Language Models: A Practical Introduction

**Instructor(s)**: João Monteiro (Autodesk) is a Research Scientist at Autodesk, with interests in autoregressive generative modeling and information retrieval, and a focus in multimodal settings. In particular, João has been focusing on devising approaches to render inference of language models more efficient, especially in settings where models should be given very large input prompts. Moreover, João has focused on robustness aspects of various model classes across various settings such as testing for the ability of language models to find knowledge in user-provided content, or on how to train encoders able to operate in multiple data modalities and across varying languages. João obtained a PhD from the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique – University of Quebec in Montreal, where he focused on applications of generative modeling and metric learning to voice biometrics settings. His goal was to improve the state-of-the-art in tasks such as speaker verification and spoken language identification, while also improving the robustness of such approaches against spoofing attackers that relied on synthetic data.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to modern language modeling, covering both theoretical foundations and practical implementation. Students will explore the complete lifecycle of large language models - from tokenization and architecture design to advanced fine-tuning techniques. The course begins with fundamental concepts in autoregressive modeling and transformer architectures, then delves into pre-training methodologies including BPE tokenization, masked language modeling, and decoder training. The latter half focuses on post-training techniques, where students will learn to create instruction-tuning datasets and implement both Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The series concludes with an examination of evaluation methodologies, including benchmark testing and human evaluation protocols. Through hands-on exercises and practical implementations, students will gain direct experience with each stage of the language model development pipeline, preparing them to work with and contribute to the rapidly evolving field of language modeling.

## Service Engineering: From Design to Operation

**Instructor(s)**: Pablo Fernandez (University of Seville, Spain) is an accredited Full Professor of Software Engineering at the University of Sevilla. Throughout his career, he has participated in more than 30 research and transfer projects with extensive collaboration with private companies and public administrations. All this activity has been developed within the Applied Software Engineering Group (ISA Group), contributing to its creation in 2007. Currently, he leads the Service Line, which focuses on evolving service science and engineering in the context of service governance over the cloud continuum. He regularly collaborates with different groups internationally, with more than 60 publications in international journals and conferences; he has been an invited scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, the Technical University of Vienna (TWU), and Newcastle University. In recent years, he was appointed as Director for research resources at the Vice-Chancellor’s Office for Research of the University of Sevilla, coordinating the governance, design and evolution of IT Systems to optimize the management and procedures that support the research activity for the community of 4000+ researchers in the University. Before his academic career, he played the roles of Software Architect and Project Manager in different firms, acting as IT Infrastructure supervisor during the Athens 2004 Olympics.
