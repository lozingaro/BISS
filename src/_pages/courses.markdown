## Quantum Computing and Software Engineering

**Instructor**: Shaukat Ali (Simula Research Laboratory, Norway)
{: .notice}

Quantum software will enable fascinating future applications. However, creating dependable quantum software that executes on quantum computers and delivers these applications requires new software engineering methods, tools, and best practices. To this end, a novel field of Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is emerging, covering areas like quantum software modeling, coding, testing, debugging, and repair, which will be a key focus of this course, presenting different methods across these areas. Moreover, this course will focus on engineering dependable quantum and classical software in combination with two groundbreaking technologies: quantum computing and AI. To this end, this course will cover techniques, including applying classical AI methods to solve QSE problems. Moreover, it will cover techniques on using quantum AI techniques (e.g. quantum extreme learning machines and quantum annealing) to solve classical software engineering problems (e.g. testing).

## Building Language Models: A Practical Introduction

**Instructor(s)**: Jo√£o Monteiro (Autodesk)
{: .notice}

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to modern language modeling, covering both theoretical foundations and practical implementation. Students will explore the complete lifecycle of large language models - from tokenization and architecture design to advanced fine-tuning techniques. The course begins with fundamental concepts in autoregressive modeling and transformer architectures, then delves into pre-training methodologies including BPE tokenization, masked language modeling, and decoder training. The latter half focuses on post-training techniques, where students will learn to create instruction-tuning datasets and implement both Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The series concludes with an examination of evaluation methodologies, including benchmark testing and human evaluation protocols. Through hands-on exercises and practical implementations, students will gain direct experience with each stage of the language model development pipeline, preparing them to work with and contribute to the rapidly evolving field of language modeling.

## Service Engineering: From Design to Operation

**Instructor(s)**: Pablo Fernandez (University of Seville, Spain)
{: .notice}

This course provides an overview of service engineering, guiding participants through the entire service lifecycle, from design to operation. It begins by emphasizing the significance of effective service design in supporting research artifacts. Participants will gain insights into best practices for creating and implementing services that enhance accessibility and reusability. It will navigate critical aspects such as security, performance monitoring, and telemetry, underscoring their importance in ensuring reliable, high-quality service delivery. The course also explores pricing strategies and service level agreements (SLAs), highlighting how these components contribute to the long-term sustainability and scalability of services. Finally, participants will examine future trends and strategies, preparing them to address emerging challenges and develop innovative, efficient systems.
